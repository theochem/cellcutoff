/** @brief
        3D/2D/1D/0D cell and derived quantities in a 3D space.

    Upon construction, an object of this class acts as a read-only representation of the
    cell. Reciprocal cell vectors, cell vector lengths and spacings between crystal planes
    are computed immediately. Several manipulations of fractional or Cartesian coordinates
    are implemented.

    Even though lower-dimensional periodic boundary conditions are supported, this class
    is specific for 3D systems. In case of 0D, 1D or 2D PBC, the "active" cell vectors are
    internally extended with "inactive" cell vectors, i.e. an orthonormal set of basis
    vectors to guarantee an invertible transformation between Cartesian and fractional
    coordinates. In that case, the fractional coordinates are actually also Cartesian
    coordinates in directions orthogonal to the available cell vectors. The extra basis
    vectors are always such that the complete set of vectors is right-handed.

  /** @brief
          Selects a cells inside or intersecting with a cutoff sphere.

      This function assumes space is divided in a regular grid of subcells. The shape of
      one subcell is defined by `vecs` and `nvec` (>= 1). This function then finds all
      subcells that overlap with a cutoff sphere.

      @param center
          A pointer to 3 doubles that specify the center of the cutoff sphere in
          Cartesian coordinates.

      @param cutoff
          The cutoff radius.

      @param bars
          A std::vector<int> pointer in which the results, i.e. the cells overlapping with
          the cutoff sphere, are stored.

          To keep the array compact, the following format is used to specify all cells
          that overlap with the cutoff sphere. The integers are always to be interpreted
          in (begin, end) pairs, corresponding to crystal planes just before and after the
          cutoff sphere. The first pair, (begin0, end0), corresponds to the planes along
          the [100] direction. If `nvec==2`, a list of pairs follows, corresponding to
          (begin1, end1) ranges along the [010] direction. One such pair is present for
          each slice of the cutoff sphere along the [100] direction, i.e. for (begin0,
          begin0 + 1), (begin0 + 1, begin0 + 2), etc. Similarly, if `nvec==3`, each pair
          for the [010] direction is followed with a set of pairs for the [001] direction.

          The above format assumes that one know `nvec` when parsing the list of integers.

      @return
          The number bars. The size of the bars vector is `nbar*(nvec+1)`.
